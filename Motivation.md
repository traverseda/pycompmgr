Due to the high performance requirements of a compositing manager, it might seem a bit odd that I chose to write one using a scripting language. This probably makes my compositing manager unsuitable for every day purposes on slower machines and/or with more complicated effects.

My motivation to build a compositing manager was two-fold. Firstly, I love working with X--and all compositing managers were written in C, so why not try developing a compositing manager with a different tool? I wanted to learn how to build a compositing manager myself, and this was the easiest way to go about it. Secondly, _how to_ build a compositing manager is not very accessible, and pycompmgr could serve as a learning tool to those interested in building one.
